# This is a an example of comment in python
# We use comments to document our code and leave breadcrumbs for ourselves


# GOALS
# What is your our goal for today's Session?
# I want you to understand what a python script (program) looks like and how to run one.
# I want to introduce you to basic building blocks of the language.
# It's okay if everything doesn't immediately make sense
# Programming sounds hard and can be intimidating but not rocket science. There is a lot of information
# How to eat an elephant? One bite at a time ...

# Why Learn to Code?

# Building things is cool.
# You can build a website to let people list items and let other people buy them online aka Tradesy
# The only limitation to what you can build in software is your own creativity + time.
# You can literally build a billion dollar company if the thing you build is something people want.


# In data team we build software to power the analytics of the business.
# Analytics are life blood in making critical business decisions.

# So lets jump into it!
# The most common program for people just starting

print("Hello World!")

# What is print going to do?
# Print is a function that is printing the characters within the round brackets to the screen.
# What is a function? A function is block of code that can be reused. A super powerful building block


# Exercise 1

# Open up your terminal
# Type in python hello.py

# Exercise 2
# Remove the last bracket in line #26 then run the program
# What happens ?

# Google the error message


# What is Programming Syntax?
# Is the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured statements or expressions in that language







# Congrats you have a bug in your program!

# FUN FACT: The term "bug" was used in an account by computer pioneer Grace Hopper, who publicized the cause of a malfunction in an early electromechanical computer. ...
# Operators traced an error to a moth trapped in a relay, coining the term bug. This bug was carefully removed and taped to the log book.

# This program is 1. Lets do something a bit more fun and meatier.
